This process is unlicensed, but certain components, while all are publically
available, may have different licensing requirements.

To the best of my knowledge, the methods outlined above do not violate
any existing licensing terms.

Where practical, permissons have been sought and granted for use of
certain techniques (e.g., AddOns UI and Diversion email).

If you port, improve, extend or otherwise modify the concepts included in this
process, I only ask for a courtesy attribution, a reference back to this work.

Please publish any modifications or improvements back for the general community
to derive benefit.
